People read antique texts today, yet the majority of them barely have any illustrations. Yet when you read a text and look at images that are related to it, you can better understand what you just read.
So here it is—our system, which creates the images based on the tale it receives as input. For instance, if you read about the war in the Mahabharata and then see an image of it, you would comprehend it better and, more importantly, you will be able to visualise it better. Its difficult to visualize  an event without an image. Also, this approach can be applied when giving stories to kindergarten students so they can visualise utilising pictures.
The second role of our technology is to convert any native language—basically a text—into the language that the user choose. So, books published in one's mother tongue can be translated into that language using this technology over the internet.
